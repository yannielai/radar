<p>
Nymi is a heart beat authentication device. We want to take advantage of its ability to read ECG (electrocardiogram). <br><br>

Taking advantage of  technology, our team has devised a cost effective home monitoring system for ECG called Cor. Our smart phone application will help patients with cardiac disorder or those who are susceptible to cardiac discorders, such as diabetic patients, to monitor heart health at home. Our app will not replace standard medical procedures, but will be a convenient method for everyday people with Nymi to monitor their health.<br><br>

Our application will be able to compare patient baseline heart rhythm and compare it to abnormal threshold levels. If severe abnormality is present, an alert system will activate. A call or message will be sent to patient family. This alert system will ensure that proper medical treatment will be seeked before anything more serious, such as heart attack or stroke, occurs. <br><br> Because Cor requires manual activation of the recording process, our application can send a reminder at patient's desired time interval. The reminder can take form in the smart phone or as a Nymi band vibration. <br><br> Additionally, our application will provide a visual representation of the ECG data to allow patients to track their heart rhythm.
